# Turtlebot Setup and operation

Most of the ROS2 Turtlebot software (nodes) run on the desktop computer. Cartographer and Navigation are too demanding for CPU and memory to fit on the on-board Raspberry Pi. Also, Rviz, Rqt and Rqt_graph with their UI can't run on the headless RPi Ubuntu Server.

Here is how we set up a Linux desktop machine (mine is Intel I5 with 8GB memory)


4. Teleoperate the robot using the desktop's joystick

5. Map your room by running ROS2 Cartographer package

6. Navigate around by using Nav2 package

7. Optionally, explore cameras and other devices on the robot
